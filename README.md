# data-structures

Implement a singly-linked list in Python:   
  - push(val) will insert the value ‘val’ at the head of the list
  - pop() will pop the first value off the head of the list and return it.
  - size() will return the length of the list
  - search(val) will return the node containing ‘val’ in the list, if present, else None
  - remove(node) will remove the given node from the list, wherever it might be (node must be an item in the list)
  - display() will return a unicode string representing the list as if it were a Python tuple literal: “(12, ‘sam’, 37, ‘tango’)”

Implement a stack in in Python:   
  - push(value) - Adds a value to the stack. The parameter is the value to be added to the stack.
  - pop() - Removes a value from the stack and returns that value. If the stack is empty, attempts to call pop should raise an appropriate Python exception class.

Implemented a Doubly Linked list in Python:   
  - push(val) will insert the value ‘val’ at the head of the list append(val) will append the value ‘val’ at the tail of the list
  - pop() will pop the first value off the head of the list and return it.
  - shift() will remove the last value from the tail of the list and return it.
  - remove(val) will remove the first instance of ‘val’ found in the list, starting from the head. If ‘val’ is not present, it will raise an appropriate Python exception.

Implement a queue in Python:
  - enqueue(value): adds value to the queue
  - dequeue(): removes the correct item from the queue and returns its value (should raise an error if the queue is empty)
  - peek(): returns the next value in the queue without dequeueing it. If the queue is empty, returns None
  - size(): return the size of the queue. Should return 0 if the queue is empty.
